# `dm_control`: The DeepMind Control Suite and Package

# ![all domains](all_domains.png)

This package contains:

-   [`dm_control.mjcf`](dm_control/mjcf/README.md): A library for composing and modifying
    MuJoCo MJCF models in Python.

-   [`dm_control.mujoco`](dm_control/mujoco/README.md): Libraries that provide Python
    bindings to the MuJoCo physics engine.

-   [`dm_control.suite`](dm_control/suite/README.md): A set of Python Reinforcement
    Learning environments powered by the MuJoCo physics engine.

-   [`dm_control.viewer`](dm_control/viewer/README.md): An interactive environment viewer.

## Installation and requirements

Follow these steps to install `dm_control`:

1.  Download MuJoCo Pro 2.00 from the download page on the
    [MuJoCo website](http://www.mujoco.org/). MuJoCo Pro must be installed
    before `dm_control`, since `dm_control`'s install script generates Python
    [`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html) bindings based on
    MuJoCo's header files. By default, `dm_control` assumes that the MuJoCo Zip
    archive is extracted as `~/.mujoco/mujoco200_$PLATFORM` where `$PLATFORM` is
    either `linux`, `win64`, or `macos`.

2.  Install the `dm_control` Python package by running `pip install
    git+git://github.com/deepmind/dm_control.git` (PyPI package coming soon) or
    by cloning the repository and running `pip install /path/to/dm_control/`. We
    recommend `pip install`ing into a `virtualenv`, or with the `--user` flag to
    avoid interfering with system packages. At installation time, `dm_control`
    looks for the MuJoCo headers from Step 1 in
    `~/.mujoco/mujoco200_$PLATFORM/include`, however this path can be configured
    with the `headers-dir` command line argument.

3.  Install a license key for MuJoCo, required by `dm_control` at runtime. See
    the [MuJoCo license key page](https://www.roboti.us/license.html) for
    further details. By default, `dm_control` looks for the MuJoCo license key
    file at `~/.mujoco/mjkey.txt`.

4.  If the license key (e.g. `mjkey.txt`) or the shared library provided by
    MuJoCo Pro (e.g. `libmujoco200.so` or `libmujoco200.dylib`) are installed at
    non-default paths, specify their locations using the `MJKEY_PATH` and
    `MJLIB_PATH` environment variables respectively.

## Additional instructions for Linux

The MuJoCo Python bindings support three different OpenGL rendering backends:
EGL (headless, hardware-accelerated), GLFW (windowed, hardware-accelerated),
and OSMesa (purely software-based). At least one of these three backends
must be available in order render through `dm_control`.

*   "Headless" hardware rendering (i.e. without a windowing system such as X11)
    requires [EXT_platform_device](https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_platform_device.txt)
    support in the EGL driver. Recent Nvidia drivers support this. You will also
    need GLEW. On Debian and Ubuntu, this can be installed via
    `sudo apt-get install libglew2.0`.

*   Hardware rendering with a windowing system is also supported via GLFW and
    GLEW, which can be installed via your Linux distribution's package manager.
    For example, on Debian and Ubuntu, this can be done by running
    `sudo apt-get install libglfw3 libglew2.0`.

*   Software rendering requires GLX and OSMesa. On Debian and Ubuntu these can
    be installed using `sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libosmesa6`.

By default, `dm_control` will attempt to use EGL first, then GLFW, then OSMesa.
You can also specify a particular backend to use by setting the
`MUJOCO_GL=` environment variable to `"egl"`, `"glfw"`, or `"osmesa"`,
respectively.

## Additional instructions for Homebrew users on macOS

1.  The above instructions using `pip` should work, provided that you use a
    Python interpreter that is installed by Homebrew (rather than the
    system-default one).

2.  Before running, the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable needs to be
    updated with the path to the GLFW library. This can be done by running
    `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(brew --prefix)/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
